			<p> Today I decided I wanted to mess around with some ML. I wanted to try and make an image classifier for this game character from the game Don't Starve Together, maybe for future use with a RL agent. (That isn't the focus of this post though)
			So I recorded myself playing the game for maybe 30 minutes. I converted all the frames of the video into single images. The total images is 8162 images (Some 15.4 GB!). Now there is no way I am going to sit around crop out of the character 
			I want to create my dataset for training. So I decided to have a G1ANT Robot do that for me! </p>
